# wait-time-analysis-in-canadian-hospitals

A data-driven exploration of hospital wait times across Canada using **Python**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**. The project analyzes over **18,000+ records** from 2008–2024 to uncover trends, disparities, and key bottlenecks in medical procedures across provinces.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 📅 **Temporal Analysis:** Wait time trends over 15+ years for 20+ procedures
- 📍 **Regional Variations:** Up to **30% fluctuation** in wait times across 10+ provinces
- 🧪 **Procedure Volatility:** Measured variability using coefficient of variation to highlight unstable metrics
- 📊 **Percentile Insights:** Compared 50th vs 90th percentile wait times to capture patient experience distribution

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.13:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib for cleaning + EDA  
- **Excel:** Consolidated multi-sheet output for Power BI ingestion  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards to visualize wait time patterns

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Overview

- Average wait times by **Province**, **Procedure**, and **Metric**
- Top 5 most delayed procedures per year
- Year-over-year change in wait times
- Volatility analysis using standard deviation and coefficient of variation
- Fully filterable by province, procedure, and year

> 📌 *All EDA results were exported to Excel and used directly in Power BI to build visual stories.*

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- Cleaned and normalized a messy multi-year dataset for **18,000+ entries**
- Identified top delay-heavy procedures for each year
- Built a **multi-sheet EDA workbook** and converted insights into an interactive Power BI experience
